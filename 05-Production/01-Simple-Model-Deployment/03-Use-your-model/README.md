# Objective

Use and evaluate your model

## Make predictions locally

First complete `predict_local.py` file to evaluate the model locally, and save prediction to a `prediction.csv` file


## Ask GCP AI Platform for the predictions 

Now complete `predict.py` file to obtain online predictions from AI Platform

## To go further

Take a step back and evaluate your model.  

- How good is your model ? 
- Was the model choice a wise choice ? 
- Why did you chose that model ? If your were to change model, which one would you chose and why ?

Create a jupyter notebook to visualise your predictions :  
 - Are local predictions same as online predictions ?
 - Visualise predictions as using a scatter plot, how good is your model ?
