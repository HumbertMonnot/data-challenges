# Objective

Use and evaluate your model

## First locally

First complete `predict_local.py` file to evaluate the model locally

## Then using AI platform python api

Now complete `predict.py` file to obtain online predictions from google

## To go further

Create a jupyter notebook to visualise your predictions :  
 - Are local predictions same as online predictions ?
 - Visualise predictions as using `seaborn.pairplot`, how good is your model ?
