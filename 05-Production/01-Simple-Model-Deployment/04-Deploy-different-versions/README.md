# Objective

Feel free to train multiple versions of the model and compare their performance.


## Guidelines
You can use the same features but different sklearn estimators. 
For example:
- Lasso
- Ridge
- GradientBoostingRegressor
- Support Vector Machines
- etc..


You can try different features, for instance :
- compute distance from pickup to dropoff
- delete null distance rows
