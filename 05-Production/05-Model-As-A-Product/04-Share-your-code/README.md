## Objective 

Create a package and share it with your colleagues

## How do I share my code ?

_Speech is silver, silence is gold_  
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/lologibus2/wagon_tools.git
```
```bash
from wagon_tools.lib import get_data
get_data()
```

## Share your own library
You just understood how to opensource you code right ? Do it yourself now 

You will now share your first module with all your colleagues. 

Create a project with `wagon-make-package` command:
- Name it as you please
- add a try_me() function to `lib.py` file
- return whatever you want with that function 
- delete git from your project by running `rm -rf .git` inside your project
- create a repository on github, add you project to your repo
- follow instructions from github

Publish the link to your project on the slack channel.  
Your colleagues should've done the same thing, add all their repo to a requirements.txt file and test their function
