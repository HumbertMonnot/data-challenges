You'll want to add libraries to Airflow's python environment

## Add your python libraries to requirements.txt file

Complete `requirements.txt` with all the libraries you needed from past days

_NB : next exercices will include ETL, trainings, requests to BQ, ..._

Run to test:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Update Airflow Environement
Inspect Makefile and run
```bash
make update_dependencies
```
This might take a while so feel free to jump to next exercice
