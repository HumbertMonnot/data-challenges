In this notebook, we look at a way to use a pre-trained model for a different task. Namely, we will take a vgg16 neural network (https://neurohive.io/en/popular-networks/vgg16/), remove its fully connected layers, add new connected layers with the right ouput format and retrain only these layers to a classification task on flowers.
We take vgg16 trained on Imagenet (a very large database of images of different categories), so that its filters are already trained to 'see' and extract meaningful features from the images.
