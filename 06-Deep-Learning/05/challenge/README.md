# Deep Learning Challenge: Review classification


#### Task & Data

You have 200.000 Yelp reviews, associated to the number of starts associated to the review, from 1 (very poor) to 5 (very positive).

The train set contains the reviews and the number of stars. The test set only contains the review.

You can download the dataset here: [DL-06-challenge.csv.zip](http://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/DL-05-challenge.zip)

#### Objectives
This is a sentiment analysis task: you will predict the number of stars related to a review.
You have to clean and process the data, and then build a model (Neural Network) to predict the number of starts given a review.

You will be provided a test dataset that you have to predict. This will be used to score your submissions


#### Setting
In this challenge, you a not supervised by questions and notebooks as previously.
This is similar to real life problems: you have some data file that you load and that you work on, from scratch.
Obviously, the teachers are here to help you building your whole pipeline: _do not hesitate_ to ask questions, especially if you are not sure of your different steps.
