In this exercise, you will use the **Naive Bayes** algorithm and compare it to the **KNN** algorithm.
The goal is to learn how to simulate your own data to get insights and test hypotheses.
We will inspect the importance of correlation between features in the Naive Bayes algorithm and the time required to do predictions with these two algorithms.

Let's get started by opening the notebook `04- Naive-Bayes-Simulations.ipynb`.
