In this exercise, we will analyze the **price per night on Airbnb** (in copenhagen).

Imagine you have a flat and you want to rent it on Airbnb. You'll probably want to choose the right price so you can maximize your revenue, right?

Our goal here is to predict the price per night thanks to the KNN Algorithm.

To start the exercise, open `KNN_airbnb_predictions.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
