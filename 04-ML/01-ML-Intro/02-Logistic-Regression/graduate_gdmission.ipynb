    "1. If your **CGPA is 7.8**, what is the **probability** that you will be accepted in an university with a **rating of 3**?\n",
    "2. If your **CGPA is 8.5**, which is the **best university** you can apply to and have a probability of more than **50%** to be accepted?\n",
    "3. What should be your CGPA in order to have a probabilty of **80%** to enter in the **best rated** univesity?\n",
    "4. With the help of you model, can you plot the **probability** to be **admited** in an university **rated 4**, by **CGPA**?"
