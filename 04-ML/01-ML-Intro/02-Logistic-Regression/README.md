### Introduction

In this exercice we are going to take a look at **Graduate Admissions** in relation to **CGPA** and **University Rating**.<br>
We will use the **logistic regression** model to answer some questions.

**Dataset:** "Admission_Predict.csv"<br>

**Columns:** <br>
**"CGPA"**, range [6.0, 10.0], Cumulative Grade Point Average <br>
**"Rating"**, range [1, 5], 5 is the best university rating<br>
**"Admited"**, range [0,1] <br>

To start the exercise, open `graduate_gdmission.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

### Exercise questions:

1. If your **CGPA is 7.8**, what is the **probability** that you will be accepted in an university with a **rating of 3**?
2. If your **CGPA is 8.5**, which is the **best university** you can apply to and have a probability of more than **50%** to be accepted?
3. What should be your CGPA in order to have a probabilty of **80%** to enter in the **best rated** univesity?
4. With the help of you model, can you plot the **probability** to be **admited** in an university **rated 4**, by **CGPA**?
