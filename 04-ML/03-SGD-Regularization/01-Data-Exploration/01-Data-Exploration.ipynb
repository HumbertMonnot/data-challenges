    "Today, you will learn to recode entirely a linear regression algorithm. Linear regression can be solved using the *normal equation* (closed-form solution) or with gradient descent (which can be faster when there are a lot of features in the dataset). Here are the steps we will implement:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 1. Start with some random parameter values: we call this *random initialization*. *Zero initialization* is also possible.\n",
    "- 2. Calculate the output of the algorithm with these parameters: this is the equivalent of *forward propagation* with neural networks.\n",
    "- 3. Calculate the error with these parameters: we compare the output of the algorithm with the ground truth (this is a supervised algorithm so we need the ground truth).\n",
    "- 4. Evaluate how to change each parameter to reduce the error and update the parameters: this is the equivalent of *backward propagation* with neural networks and gradient descent is the core of this step.\n",
