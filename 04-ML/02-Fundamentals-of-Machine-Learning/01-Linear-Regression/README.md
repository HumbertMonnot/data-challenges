In this first exercice, we will create **linear regression** models and emphasize how to use **sklearn** to do so.

We will start with a simple modeling of two data points and then focus on the practical steps needed to apply them to more complicated situations.

To start the exercise, open the notebook `linear_regression` with `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
