# Optional Exercises
Congratulations ! You have learned the basic mathematic tools we will use during the next weeks.

If you are done with all the previous exercises, you can try these challenges on Codewar :
- [Calculate the trace of a square matrix](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-trace/train/python)
- [Write a function that accepts a square matrix (N x N 2D array) and returns the determinant of the matrix.](https://www.codewars.com/kata/matrix-determinant/train/python)

# Plot some beautiful graphs
Yesterday, we saw a lot of different techniques and libraries for Data Vizualization. If you have finished all the exercises and completed the challenges from Codewar, go back to these exercises and try to finish them.
