In this challenge, we will learn how to load data from a CSV file with pure Python.

## üî• Warm-up

‚ö†Ô∏è For this warm-up, there is no `make` to run, so please read & follow the instructions closely!

Before we use a proper dataset, let's practise on something very simple.
Open the `data/phone_book.csv` file and add some lines to it. Keep the header!

As an example, it should look like this:

```csv
first_name,last_name,phone_number
John,Lennon,123
George,Harrisson,456
Ringo,Starr,789
```

The goal now is to load that data in a Python script, to use it. We are going to use the [`csv`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html) built-in module.

Open the `phone_book.py` file and copy/paste the following code:

```python
import csv

with open('data/phone_book.csv', mode='r') as csv_file:
    csv_reader = csv.reader(csv_file)
    line_count = 0
    for row in csv_reader:
        print(row)
        line_count += 1
```

In your terminal, run the file:

```bash
python phone_book.py
```

Does that seem correct to you? What is the type of the `row` variable line 7 in the `print(row)` statement? Compare your guess with your buddy, and also check the actual result with `type()`.

Try updating the code of `phone_book.py` to ignore the header (first line) and only print last name + phone number. This is the output you should get:

```bash
Lennon: 123
Harrisson: 456
Saunier: 123
```

Now try refactoring the code using the [`csv.DictReader`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.DictReader) class. You should no longer need the `line_count` variable. Also, what is the type of `row` now? Is it still the same as before? As usual, discuss about the code with your buddy and check your understanding with `type()`.

## üèÖ Olympic Winter Games

Now that you understand the basics of loading data from a CSV, let's work with a real dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/the-guardian/olympic-games). If you have a look at the `data` folder in this challenge, you will find two files coming from Kaggle (you don't need to download anything):

- `dictionary.csv`
- `winter.csv`

Go ahead and open those two files in Sublime Text to try & understand what they contain. The goal of this challenge is to implement the method in `winter_olympic_games.py`:

1. Who won the most winter olympic games medals (gold/silver/bronze) ever? (Hint: there's just one)
2. From `min_year` to `max_year`, which country won the most gold medals?
3. Find the three women with the most medals(gold/silver/bronze) in 5000 meters.

‚ö†Ô∏è For this challenge, you _can't_ use `pandas` yet üòâ. Let's see how far you can go with just Python & the [`csv` module](https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html).

For this part of the challenge, you can use to check your implementation for the two questions.

```bash
make
```

After each question is solved, please run the checks + `add`/`commit`/`push` your code in this current challenge. Don't wait to solve the two questions.

Have fun!
