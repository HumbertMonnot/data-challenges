## Background & Objectives

In the section we will discover subquery-refactoring! Indeed we may need to nest previous SQL queries coded into a new one to reduce repetition and simplify complex SQL statements. This is performed by the `WITH` ğŸ‘Œ

## Specs

### Average per Customer

ğŸ‘‰ Implement `get_average_purchase` to get the average amount spent per customer.

### General Average

ğŸ‘‰  Implement`get_general_avg_order` to get the average order in terms of price.

### Who are the best buyer?

Now let's find the customers who have made bigger order than the average.

Can you see that the main part has already been done in the 2 previous questions? Let's use our previous queries thanks to the `WITH` clause.

ğŸ‘‰ Implement the function `display_new_columns` to get all the ID's and the average amount of these best buyers!

You should get this:
`
display_best_buyers(db)
=> [(572.91, 2), (870.01, 4), (548.15, 5)]
`

Meaning that the customer 2 spent on average â‚¬572,91 per Order
