## Background & Objectives

The goal of this first challenge is to create your first table using the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com).

## Specs

#### Designing your first table

Let's create a table to store users. Each user has:

- A first name
- A last name
- An age
- And an email

What is the type of each column? Remember, all of your tables will also have an `id` column!

#### Drawing the table

Use the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com) to draw the users table with the columns specified above.
To check your solution, click on "Save / Load", then "Save XML", copy/paste the generated XML code in `users.xml`. You can then `make` to check your solution.

## Key learning points

- Become comfortable with using the [SQL Designer](http://db.lewagon.com) tool to build your schema.
- Use the correct naming conventions when naming tables and columns in your schema.
