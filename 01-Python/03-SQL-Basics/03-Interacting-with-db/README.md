## Background & Objectives

`Sqlite` is a simple database that relies on a standalone file.
You can read more on [en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQLite).

The goal of this first exercise is to use the command line to read and query
a sample database called `movies.sqlite` that we give you

## Tools

Use **DBeaver** application to read the SQLite database, explore the schema and even **run SQL queries**.

- [DBeaver](https://dbeaver.io/)

‚ùìShould I use the command-line `sqlite3` or the visual tool above? Well, both are useful! It's good to learn both for two reasons. On the one hand, a [CLI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_interface) allows you to focus on the SQL queries. On the other hand, a [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) tool will prove helpful to explore a database schema structure (tables? columns? etc.).

## Specs

The goal of this exercise is to explore the Movies database, and understand its schema. Answer the following questions:

- What is the database schema? (i.e what are the tables, and the relations between tables)
- Use SQL Design tool to draw the schema of this database.
- How many rows does each table contain? What are the column names for each table?

Use [db.lewagon.com](http://db.lewagon.com/) to draw the Movies schema. Save it in XML format to `movies.xml` and check it with `make`.
