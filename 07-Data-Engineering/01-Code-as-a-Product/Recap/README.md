**The goal of today's recap is to go over the process of creating a new package, understand the purpose of different files inside it and practice Continuous Integration and the Continuous Deployment.**
<br><br>


## Let's start and play a quiz on Slack üé≤
It's best to open the **Slack app on your phone** so that you can see lecturer's screen on your computer at all times.

<br>

### ü§î How can you create a new package?

1Ô∏è‚É£ `pip install package-name`

2Ô∏è‚É£ `mkdir package-name`

3Ô∏è‚É£ `packgenlite package-name`

</summary>

**3Ô∏è‚É£ `packgenlite package-name`**

In order to create a new package you can run:

`packgenlite bbquote`

`cd bbquote`

`tree`

You should see the entire project structure created by the `packgenlite` tool.
</details>
<br><br>

### ü§î Where can you create a new method that will belong to the package?

1Ô∏è‚É£ I would create a new `py` file within the `bbqoute` directory containing `init.py`.

2Ô∏è‚É£ I would create the method in the `init.py` file.

3Ô∏è‚É£ I would add the new command in the `Makefile`

</summary>

**1Ô∏è‚É£ I would create a new `*.py` file within the `bbqoute` directory containing `init.py`.**


```bash
touch bbquote/lib.py
```

```python
# bbquote/lib.py
import requests

def get_quote():
	url = 'https://breaking-bad-quotes.herokuapp.com/v1/quotes'
	response = requests.get(url).json()[0]

	return f"'{response['quote']}' \n> {response['author']}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
	print(get_quote())
```

</details>
<br><br>

### ü§î Can you call the method from anywhere on your machine at this point?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Yes

2Ô∏è‚É£ No

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution
</summary>

**2Ô∏è‚É£ No**

You can't as long as the package is not **installed** on your system.
In order to be able to do that you have to run:
`pip install -e .`
which will make the package executable from any location and will also listen to **any updates of the package files** (similar to `%autoreload`)
</details>
<br><br>

### ü§î You can now call the method by importing it from `bbquote.lib` anywhere on your machine or you can execute the `lib.py` file directly by running: `python bbquote/lib.py`. What can you do to be able to run `bbquote-run` in the Terminal at any location and achieve the same result?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Add the method to `requirements.txt`

2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a script which will import and call the method

3Ô∏è‚É£ Create a new directory `bbquote-run` and add the `lib.py` file containing the method inside

**2Ô∏è‚É£ Create a script which will import and call the method**


Script is an executable file that you can run from the Terminal. They are are useful with automation of the engineering tasks.
In order to convert a python file into a script you have to add two additional headers to the file and then the code which should be executed upon running the script.

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
```

Don't forget to add the script to your `setup.py` file!
</details>

### ü§î Let's now write a test for our `get_quote` method. But wait, why do we even need a test?

1Ô∏è‚É£ We want to make sure our package and its methods are working correctly in different circumstances

2Ô∏è‚É£ In case our teammate is updating the code, we are making sure the updates will not crash the package functionality

3Ô∏è‚É£ Tests are part of Continuous Integration - it helps to maintain the quality of our code before commiting the merge on a remote repository.

4Ô∏è‚É£ All of the above are correct.

**4Ô∏è‚É£ All of the above are correct.**

There are multiple reasons for introducing testing in our projects and all of the above are correct. The right question is: why _wouldn't_ you introduce testing? ü§î
</details>
<br><br>

### ü§î Let's expose our project through a public url. How you we do it?

1Ô∏è‚É£ `git push production master`

2Ô∏è‚É£ The repository is public, we don't need to do anything.

3Ô∏è‚É£ We can create a new app on Heroku and push our code with additional configuration.

4Ô∏è‚É£ None of the above.

**3Ô∏è‚É£ We can create a new app on Heroku and push our code with additional configuration.**

In order to be able to display our project on an accessible url we have to use a cloud platform enabling us to build, run and operate applications. Heroku is one of such providers. In order to deploy our application and display the functionality of the `get_quote` method we can:

1. Create an `app.py` file with simple frontend calling the method

2. Add a `setup.sh` and `Procfile` for configuration

3. Create a new app on heroku by running: `heroku create <unique-app-name>`

4. Push our code to Heroku: `git push heroku master`

5. Set the dynos to run our web application: `heroku ps:scale web=1`


In case the application has an error, don't forget to check the logs: `heroku logs --tail`.
</details>
<br><br>

### ü§î Ok, this seems like a lot of pushing: `git push origin`, `git push heroku`... Can we automate it somehow?

1Ô∏è‚É£ Yes

2Ô∏è‚É£ No

<details><summary markdown='span'>View solution

**1Ô∏è‚É£ Yes**

Yes, this process is called Continuous Deployment. With additional configuration in the `pythonpackage.yml` we can ask Github to deploy the latest code to Heroku for us if all the tests will pass.
