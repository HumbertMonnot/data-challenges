## Products

This challange takes a similar approach from the `sellers` one, but applies it to `products`

There might be some `product_id` or `product_categories` that significantly underperforms others, and that could be removed from the marketplace.

In the following notebook `product.ipynb` :
- We will create a clean training_set with every information possible about products (one row per seller)
- Then, we will analyze which product repetitively underperform others
- We will then formulate early hypothesis and patterns to use in order to increase quality supply on Olist platform

ðŸ”¥ This will be our last guided challenge of the module: the next steps will consist in creating and presenting a proper cost/benefit analysis, in order to present to the Olist CEO your recommendations.
