## Products and Sellers

So far, we have seen how `wait_time` was the most significant factor explaining low review scores, but reading comments from bad reviews also shown that some were linked the seller or the product itself...

Besides, `wait_time` is not known ahead of the order, and thus can hardly be directly tackled by your data-consulting team as a recommendation to Olist's CEO.

On the contrary, we might be able to quantify which sellers/products should we remove from the marketplace due to persistent bad reviews, in order to improve profit margin

The two following two notebooks `products.ipynb` and `sellers.ipynb` are similar in their principles:
- we will create a clean dataset with every information possible about products (respectively sellers)
- Then, we will analyze which products / sellers repetitively underperform others, and try to understand why
- We will formulate early hypothesis and patterns to use to increase quality supply on Olist platform

Start with the notebook of your choice, and only move on to the next one if you are totally done with the first.
Try to coordinate with your buddy of the day in choosing where to start!

ðŸ”¥ This will be our last guided challenges of the week: The next two days will consist in creating and presenting a proper cost/benefit analysis, for the recommendations of your choice to Olist's CEO.
