## Warm-up : a quick logistic regression

We have seen that many customers are unhappy, with 11% of orders receiving 1-star reviews.

Often, being able to identifying clearly the worst reviews (1 star) is more important than being precise in predicting the exact review score of each orders.

In this warm-up challenge, we will simply run a Logit model `dim_is_one_star` from our `orders` training set, and compare that with our OLS prediction of `review_score`.

Open the notebook `logit.ipynb` and follow instructions.
