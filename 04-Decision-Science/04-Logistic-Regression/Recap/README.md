```bash
jupyter notebook Reboot-net_profit_per_seller.ipynb
```

The goal of this exercice is to compute, for each `seller_id`:

- The **revenue** it brings (10% of each sales + 80 BRL per month)
- The **cost** associated with all its bad reviews (1-star = 100 BRL, 2-star = 50, 3-star=40)

‚ùì Let's not start all again from scratch! Import your seller training set and investigate what you already have.
