Welcome to Kitt! The teacher will now demonstrate how to work on an exercise.

## What's this is about?

The goal is to implement a `circle_area` method which takes **one** parameter,
`radius`, and returns the area of the circle of this given radius. As a reminder,
here is the formula:

Open the `demo.py` file and implement it!

There are **3 tests** checked by the `make` command. Make sure they are all green!
