# SVM Ensembles

This exercice consists of comparing the performance of three SVM models:

- Default
- Bagged
- Boosted

As you will notice, ensemble methods do not necessarily improve model performance, and finding out is a trial and error process.

To start the exercise, open `Boosted-SVM.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
