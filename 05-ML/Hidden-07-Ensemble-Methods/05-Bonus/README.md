# Bonus

Your goal is to perform fraud detection on banking activity and uncover the signals of a potential fraudulent movement. You are free to use the algorithm or ensemble strategy of your choice.

- The dataset is available for download [here](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/fraud_data.csv)
- Each observation represents an account movement
- Feature `step` represents the elapsed time in hours since the first observation of the dataset
- Think about preprocessing and feature engineering, there are many opportunities for it here ðŸ˜‰
- Look into Sklearn's Isolation Forest tool ([documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest.html#sklearn.ensemble.IsolationForest)), it could come in handy

To start the exercise, open `Bonus.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

ðŸš€ Your turn!
