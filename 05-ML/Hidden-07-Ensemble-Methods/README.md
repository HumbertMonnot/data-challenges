# Ensemble Methods

Today's challenges consist of exploring the effects of ensemble methods on the same dataset.

The dataset:
- Each observations represents a player
- Each column a characteristic of performance
- The target defines whether the player has had a professional career of less than 5 years [0] or 5 years or more [1].

The task is to correctly classify both classes as accurately as possible.

You will work with Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVMs, KNNs, and ensemble versions of each model.

Finally, the bonus is an open challenge in which your task is to detect fraudulent banking activity.
