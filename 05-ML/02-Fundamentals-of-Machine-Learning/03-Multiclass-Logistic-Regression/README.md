The exercice consists of training and scoring a Logistic Regression model for a multiclass task. You will then use the trained model to answer some questions.

The task is to predict the university rating based on the student's CGPA and whether or not he got accepted.

The dataset:
- `rating` : the rating of the university in a range [0,5]
- `CGPA` : the Cumulative Grade Points Average of the student
- `admitted` : whether or not a student is admitted to the university

To start the exercise, open `Multiclass Logistic Regression.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
