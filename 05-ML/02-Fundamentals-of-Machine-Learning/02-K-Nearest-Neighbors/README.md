The exercice consists of training, scoring, and optimizing a K-Nearest-Neighbors model. The KNN is trained on the same dataset as the previous exercice in order to compare its performance to the one of the Logistic Regression model.

The task is to predict if a student will be admitted to a university considering his CGPA and the rating of the university he is applying to.

The dataset:
- `rating` : the rating of the university in a range [0,5]
- `CGPA` : the Cumulative Grade Points Average of the student
- `admitted` : whether or not a student is admitted to the university

To start the exercise, open `KNN Classifier.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.
