# Data Preprocessing

Data preprocessing is the first step in the Machine Learning stages after the data sourcing.

In the following challenges you will explore some of the preprocessing methods:

- Binning: the art of discretize continuous data
- Dataset imbalance: manage unbalanced data
- Encoding: transformed categorical data into numbers
- Missing data: deal with it
- Scaling: force your data to fit in a given range

ðŸš€ Good luck !
