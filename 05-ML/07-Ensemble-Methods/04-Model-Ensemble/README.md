# Model Ensemble

In this exercice, you will implement an ensemble method that has been winning recent Kaggle competitions: Model Stacking! 

The aim is to:

- Optimize three models: KNN, Random Forest, SVM
- Create a boosted version of each model
- Stack the boosted versions into a single Voting Classifier

To start the exercise, open `Model-Ensemble.ipynb` in `jupyter notebook` and follow the instructions.

ðŸš€ Your turn!
