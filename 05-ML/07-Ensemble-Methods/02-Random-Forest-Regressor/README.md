## Random Forest Regressor

Well done ðŸŽ‰! You have implemented Bagging and Bootstrapping. You should now understand the keys tools hidden behing the Random Forest Regressor and Classifier.

In this challenge, we will make use of the RandomForestRegressor (we will not implement it from scratch). As you will discover this model is very powerful and easy to use. We will also use a LinearRegressor and DecisionTreeRegressor to compare the score of each model.

Open your jupyter notebook and enter the forest ! ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²ðŸŒ²
