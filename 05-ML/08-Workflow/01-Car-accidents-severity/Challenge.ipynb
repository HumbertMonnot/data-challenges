    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you'll try to predict the severity of car accidents. You'll have multiple `.csv` files at your disposition. You can load them, extract the features you think would be relevant and build a data pipeline. Then, you'll iterate on the different phase and try to get the best model! \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two folders containing data files: `data_training` that you must use to train your algorithms, and `data_validation` used to do the prediction once your model is ready. You'll send us these predictions and we'll evaluate the score (there is no target column in `data_validation`).\n",
    "\n",
    "Start by having a look at the datasets available in the folder `data`. You're free to use any data from these dataset to create the best classifier possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the variables description in the file `challenge_variable.md`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll provide you a few guidelines to help you, but feel free to be creative and try different things. However, try to not get lost in one step:\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend having the following approach: build a first version of the end-to-end pipeline with all the building blocks you need. Even if it is not perfect, the goal is to have a first baseline as soon of possible. Then you will be able to iterate and increase your model performance, playing with the steps from preprocessing to modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥\n",
    "\n",
    "### The goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the model you'll build is to predict the severity of car accidents. The target variable is called `grav` (for 'gravity') in the file `users.csv`. This variable has four levels, but in this challenge, we'll convert it to a binary variable. To do that, you need to convert the values 1 (`Unscathed`) and 4 (`Light injury`) to 0, and the values 2 (`Killed`) and 3 (`Hospitalized wounded`) to 1.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "data['grav_binary'] = data['grav'].replace({1: 0, 4: 0, 2: 1, 3: 1})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal is thus to do a binary classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Get the Data\n",
    "\n",
    "You can download the data [here](https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/04-ML_08-workflow_datasets.zip). For instance:\n",

    "curl https://wagon-public-datasets.s3.amazonaws.com/car_acccidents_datasets.zip > data.zip\n",
