# Caveats Quiz

In this exercise you will **test** your knowledge on the caveats around the plots we have seen so far.

Open your `quiz.py` and for each questions make the function return the right answers.
Make sure you run the test **only** when you have **filled every question**.

The expected return is **always** an **array** with the right answers.

Example:

```python
def one_plus_one_is():
    possible_answers = [0, 1, 2, -1]

    return [1]
```
