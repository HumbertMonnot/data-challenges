## Reviews Translator ðŸ“š

We now have a first understanding of the impact of some variables on customer satisfaction.

In this short exercise, we will confront our findings to a qualitative analysis of reviews from customers.

### Exercise

- Implement a Python script that translate from Portuguese a sample of 100 1-star reviews.
- **Do not translate all the 100,000 comments or the whole classroom might get banned from most free API translators**

ðŸ‘‰ Hint you can leverage the Python library [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/).

- Are those trends similar to your previous findings?
- What other trends are you uncovering and you would like to explore?

ðŸ’ª (Optional): Start the next day with the first exerice. This week can be done at your own speed!
