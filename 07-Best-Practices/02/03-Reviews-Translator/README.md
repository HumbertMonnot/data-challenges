## Reviews Translator ðŸ“š

We now have a first understanding of the impact of some variables on customer satisfaction. 

In this short exercise, we will confront our findings to a qualitative analysis of reviews from customers. 

### Exercise

- Implement a Python script that translate from Portuguese a sample of ~100 1 star reviews. 

ðŸ‘‰ Hint you can leverage the Python library [googletrans](https://pypi.org/project/googletrans/). 

- Are those trends similar to your previous findings? What other trends are you uncovering and you would like to explore?
