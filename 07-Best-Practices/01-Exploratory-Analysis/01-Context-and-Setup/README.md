Olist is a leading e-commerce service that connects merchants to main marketplaces in Brazil. They provide a wide range of offers from inventory management, dealing with reviews and customer contacts to logistic services.

Olist charge sellers a monthly fee. This fee is progressive with the volume of orders.

Remember the seller and customer workflows:

**Seller:**
- Seller join Olist
- Seller upload product catalogue
- Seller get notified when a product is sold.
- Seller hand over item to logistic carrier.

ðŸ‘‰ Note that multiple sellers can be involved in one customer order!

**Customer:**
- Browse products on marketplaces
- Purchase products from Olist.store
- Get an expected date for delivery
- Customer Receive order
- Customer leave a review for the order

ðŸ‘‰ A review can be left as soon as the order is sent, meaning that a customer can leave a review for a product he did not receive yet!

### Dataset
